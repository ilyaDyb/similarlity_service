Add your tasks to this file to see your progress. Try to write beautifully and thoughtfully, so that everyone is comfortable. And agree on who solves what task.

## SIMILARITY_ALGORITHM:
- Add the ability to use multiple threads to analyze a track

## BACKEND:
- Consider the possibility for track authors to specify tags for a song. Install the song database with tags in advance.

## TESTS:
- Very many many tests of the song selection algorithm
    Test the behavior of the algorithms for the following scenarios:
        - The same track but with different arrangements (remixes)
        - Similar tracks according to other services
        - Tracks of the same genre, the most obvious one is phonk
        - Similar songs in my personal opinion

        + Identical tracks
        +- Different tracks (I think more testing is needed for this)
- Сonsider reducing the duration of track analysis - will it greatly affect the result of the algorithm
- Сonsider the possibility of reducing the quality of processing without losing the final result

## OTHER:
- Decide how to exchange backend with algorithm in python (REST or execute)
